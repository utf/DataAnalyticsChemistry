Matbench is an automated leaderboard for benchmarking state of the art ML algorithms predicting a diverse range of solid materials' properties. It is hosted and maintained by the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/).\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is perform data analysis on this dataset. You should submit your finished notebook and present your findings as a group (20 minutes + 10 minutes questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is always to check the literature. Read the MatBench paper and the models that have been tested. Try to understand the features that have been used. Next you can begin with the data analysis. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "- What does your data contain. Is it computed or from experiments.\n",
    "- How reliable is the data. What sort of errors do you expect?\n",
    "- If you have been assigned a composition only dataset, what impact do you expect this to have on the model performance.\n",
    "- If you have been assigned a dataset with structures, does this make the problem more difficult or easier?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**\n",
    "- What are features in your dataset.\n",
    "- Compare & contrast methods of featurisation (fingerprints have no real-life equivalents as opposed to descriptors etc.)\n",
    "- Can you use other featurisation methods or representation of crystals (e.g. graphs if a structure is available)? Note, this is more advanced and an entirely optional step. See the code in the rest of this notebook to see how the features were generated and to give you ideas of how to modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    "- Get the most important predictors from a random forest, XGBoost, or another model, does that say anything about chemistry?\n",
    "- Classify crystals according to their properties. Would you be able to predict the performance of new crystals? \n",
    "- Attempt to predict the target property? How well does this compare against the other models on the MatBench leaderboard? How do your models differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    "- Attempt to cluster the molecules based on their features? Can you understand anything from the clustering about the materials in the dataset or their performance.\n",
    "- Some problems have many features. Does dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or recursive feature elimination) help? This can be interesting to see if featurisation matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explainability**\n",
    "- Is your model interpretable? What does it say?\n",
    "- You can perform [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (SHapley Additive exPlanation) analysis for greater insight\n",
    "- Otherwise, can you use feature importance or counterfactual explanations to provide further insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials screening (advanced)**\n",
    "- Note, this is more advanced and an entirely optional step.\n",
    "- The Materials Project contains a database of 200,000 known and predicted inorganic materials. \n",
    "- You can download the structures and compositions of all of the materials using the [Materials Project API](https://docs.materialsproject.org/downloading-data/using-the-api). A good tutorial is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4hSkv1Ghbk)\n",
    "- What happens if you apply your models to the full data set? Can you find any materials with interesting properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "The featurised datasets are available to download as csv files from the links below. Note the files and gzipped and should be uncompressed before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team A**: [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utf/DataAnalyticsChemistry/refs/heads/main/datasets/team-a.csv.gz) \n",

    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your Jupyter notebook and associated files as a zip before the deadline (9 am on January 9th). Make sure you adhere to the following guidance:\n",
    "- Structure your notebook clearly, with designated sections.\n",
    "- Include a brief introduction to the task, explaining what you did and why you did it.\n",
    "- Provide appropriate and clearly labelled figures and tables documenting your findings.\n",
    "- Summarise your findings and put them into context.\n",
    "- Comment your code so we can follow along.\n",
    "- Include an **authors contribution commentary** following the [CRediT system](https://credit.niso.org).\n",
    "- Include a **statement on the use of generative AI** following [Imperial's guidance](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/library/learning-support/generative-ai-guidance/).\n",
    "- Include a **requirements.txt** that lists the packages (and ideally versions) of the codes required to run your notebook. You can see the example for notebooks in this course [here](https://github.com/utf/DataAnalyticsChemistry/blob/main/requirements.txt).\n",

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@article{doi:10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124,\\nauthor = {Zhuo, Ya and Mansouri Tehrani, Aria and Brgoch, Jakoah},\\ntitle = {Predicting the Band Gaps of Inorganic Solids by Machine Learning},\\njournal = {The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters},\\nvolume = {9},\\nnumber = {7},\\npages = {1668-1673},\\nyear = {2018},\\ndoi = {10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124},\\nnote ={PMID: 29532658},\\neprint = {\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124\\n\\n}}']\n",

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@Misc{LandoltBornstein1997:sm_lbs_978-3-540-47679-5_2,\\nauthor=\"Kawazoe, Y.\\nand Masumoto, T.\\nand Tsai, A.-P.\\nand Yu, J.-Z.\\nand Aihara Jr., T.\",\\neditor=\"Kawazoe, Y.\\nand Yu, J.-Z.\\nand Tsai, A.-P.\\nand Masumoto, T.\",\\ntitle=\"Nonequilibrium Phase Diagrams of Ternary Amorphous Alloys {\\\\textperiodcentered} 1 Introduction: Datasheet from Landolt-B{\\\\\"o}rnstein - Group III Condensed Matter {\\\\textperiodcentered} Volume 37A: ``Nonequilibrium Phase Diagrams of Ternary Amorphous Alloys\\'\\' in SpringerMaterials (https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/10510374{\\\\_}2)\",\\npublisher=\"Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\",\\nnote=\"Copyright 1997 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\",\\nnote=\"Part of SpringerMaterials\",\\nnote=\"accessed 2018-10-23\",\\ndoi=\"10.1007/10510374_2\",\\nurl=\"https://materials.springer.com/lb/docs/sm_lbs_978-3-540-47679-5_2\"\\n}', '@Article{Ward2016,\\nauthor={Ward, Logan\\nand Agrawal, Ankit\\nand Choudhary, Alok\\nand Wolverton, Christopher},\\ntitle={A general-purpose machine learning framework for predicting properties of inorganic materials},\\njournal={Npj Computational Materials},\\nyear={2016},\\nmonth={Aug},\\nday={26},\\npublisher={The Author(s)},\\nvolume={2},\\npages={16028},\\nnote={Article},\\nurl={http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npjcompumats.2016.28}\\n}']\n",

They consist of statistical measures of elemental properties that have been weighted according to the chemical formula including the minimum value across all elements, maximum value, range, mean, standard deviation, and mode (total 132 features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset also has the crystal structure available, we also include the site stats fingerprint. This method calculates order parameters for the different sites (e.g. how tetrahedral, octahedral, square planar, etc the site is, and the coordination number) and calculates statistical properties (mean and standard deviation) of these over the full structure. Specifically, we use the `CrystalNNFingerprint` where the order parameters are introduced in the paper [\"Local structure order parameters and site fingerprints for quantification of coordination environment and crystal structure similarity\" (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9RA07755C).\n",

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@Article{deJong2015,\\nauthor={de Jong, Maarten and Chen, Wei and Angsten, Thomas\\nand Jain, Anubhav and Notestine, Randy and Gamst, Anthony\\nand Sluiter, Marcel and Krishna Ande, Chaitanya\\nand van der Zwaag, Sybrand and Plata, Jose J. and Toher, Cormac\\nand Curtarolo, Stefano and Ceder, Gerbrand and Persson, Kristin A.\\nand Asta, Mark},\\ntitle={Charting the complete elastic properties\\nof inorganic crystalline compounds},\\njournal={Scientific Data},\\nyear={2015},\\nmonth={Mar},\\nday={17},\\npublisher={The Author(s)},\\nvolume={2},\\npages={150009},\\nnote={Data Descriptor},\\nurl={http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2015.9}\\n}']\n",

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@Article{Choudhary2017,\\nauthor={Choudhary, Kamal\\nand Kalish, Irina\\nand Beams, Ryan\\nand Tavazza, Francesca},\\ntitle={High-throughput Identification and Characterization of Two-dimensional Materials using Density functional theory},\\njournal={Scientific Reports},\\nyear={2017},\\nvolume={7},\\nnumber={1},\\npages={5179},\\nabstract={We introduce a simple criterion to identify two-dimensional (2D) materials based on the comparison between experimental lattice constants and lattice constants mainly obtained from Materials-Project (MP) density functional theory (DFT) calculation repository. Specifically, if the relative difference between the two lattice constants for a specific material is greater than or equal to 5%, we predict them to be good candidates for 2D materials. We have predicted at least 1356 such 2D materials. For all the systems satisfying our criterion, we manually create single layer systems and calculate their energetics, structural, electronic, and elastic properties for both the bulk and the single layer cases. Currently the database consists of 1012 bulk and 430 single layer materials, of which 371 systems are common to bulk and single layer. The rest of calculations are underway. To validate our criterion, we calculated the exfoliation energy of the suggested layered materials, and we found that in 88.9% of the cases the currently accepted criterion for exfoliation was satisfied. Also, using molybdenum telluride as a test case, we performed X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering experiments to benchmark our calculations and understand their applicability and limitations.

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@article{Jain2013,\\nauthor = {Jain, Anubhav and Ong, Shyue Ping and Hautier, Geoffroy and Chen, Wei and Richards, William Davidson and Dacek, Stephen and Cholia, Shreyas and Gunter, Dan and Skinner, David and Ceder, Gerbrand and Persson, Kristin a.},\\ndoi = {10.1063/1.4812323},\\nissn = {2166532X},\\njournal = {APL Materials},\\nnumber = {1},\\npages = {011002},\\ntitle = {{The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation}},\\nurl = {http://link.aip.org/link/AMPADS/v1/i1/p011002/s1\\\\&Agg=doi},\\nvolume = {1},\\nyear = {2013}\\n}', '@article{Petousis2017,\\nauthor={Petousis, Ioannis and Mrdjenovich, David and Ballouz, Eric\\nand Liu, Miao and Winston, Donald and Chen, Wei and Graf, Tanja\\nand Schladt, Thomas D. and Persson, Kristin A. and Prinz, Fritz B.},\\ntitle={High-throughput screening of inorganic compounds for the\\ndiscovery of novel dielectric and optical materials},\\njournal={Scientific Data},\\nyear={2017},\\nmonth={Jan},\\nday={31},\\npublisher={The Author(s)},\\nvolume={4},\\npages={160134},\\nnote={Data Descriptor},\\nurl={http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.134}\\n}']\n",
