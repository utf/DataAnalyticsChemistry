    "# 2. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Taught by: Dat Doan, Alex Ganose\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second practical session! As always, the notebook is designed to be run online directly in your browser by clicking the rocket icon on the top right and selecting `Live Code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will cover the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision trees for classification\n",
    "1. Decision trees for regression\n",
    "1. Ensemble learning – bagging and random forests\n",
    "1. Model evaluation and training protocols\n",
    "1. Hyperparameter optimisation\n",
    "1. Task: Classifying metallicity \n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision trees – classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a simple yet versatile algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. They are a fundamental component of ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosted trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "- Don't require much data preparation.\n",
    "- Make few assumptions about the training data.\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and visualise.\n",
    "- Predictions are fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "- Default training algorithmm (CART) is greedy. It preduces a solution that is reasonably good but is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution (finding this is intractable even for small datasets).\n",
    "- Very sensitive to dataset variations – small details lead to large changes in the model.\n",
    "- They struggle to describe linear functions well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details about the decision trees on the excellent [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the iris dataset from scikit-learn that we used in Workshop 1. As a reminder, this dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features. The target variable is the species of iris, which can be one of three possible values: setosa, versicolor, or virginica (given as integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively).\n",
