    "# 4. Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Taught by: Dat Doan, Alex Ganose\n",
    "\n",
    "The start of this notebook was inspired by the [ML for Materials](https://github.com/aronwalsh/MLforMaterials) course developed by Prof. Aron Walsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third practical session! As always, the notebook is designed to be run online directly in your browser by clicking the rocket icon on the top right and selecting `Live Code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will cover the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The perceptron\n",
    "1. Multi-layer perceptrons\n",
    "1. NNs with PyTorch\n",
    "1. Image classification\n",
    "1. Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "1. Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "A short history of neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1943: McCulloch and Pitts propose a mathematical model of a neuron in the landmark paper [\"A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity\"](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02478259).\n",
    "- 1958: Rosenblatt introduces the perceptron, a simple neural network model.\n",
    "- Dark years: Neural networks fall out of favor due to limitations in training algorithms and computational power. Funding for neural network research is cut.\n",
    "- 1980s: Neural networks experience a resurgence due to the development of backpropagation and the increasing availability of computational resources.\n",
    "- 1980: Hopfield introduces the [Hopfield network](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554), a type of recurrent neural network.\n",
    "- 1986: Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams publish a paper on backpropagation, a method for training neural networks.\n",
    "- 2012: AlexNet wins the ImageNet competition, demonstrating the power of deep learning.\n",
    "- 2016: AlphaGo defeats the world champion Go player, demonstrating the power of deep reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "They can be used to classify billions of images, translate languages in real-time, and play games at a superhuman level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biological vs artificial neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological neural networks are composed of interconnected neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals.\n",
    "These networks are responsible for processing information, learning, and controlling behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks but are much simpler in structure and function.\n",
    "There are many different types of neural networks, each with its own architecture and set of rules for updating the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Biological neurons | Artificial neurons | \n",
    "| :--- | ---: | \n",
    "| Composed of *dendrites*, a *cell body* and an *axon*.  | Composed of *input connections + synaptic weights*, a *summing junction* and an *activation function*. | \n",
    "| Sends signals in the form of *neurotransmitters* (chemicals) into the *synaptic terminals* | Sends signals in the form of *numbers* (in 1943: binary on/off) into the *output connection* |\n",
    "| Activates when *cell body* receives a sufficient amount of signals through *dendrites* | Activates when sufficient number of *input connections* are active |\n",
    "\n",
    "## The perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network. \n",
    "It is a single-layer neural network that takes in a set of inputs and produces a single output. \n",
    "The output is calculated by taking the dot product of the input vector and a set of weights, and passing the result through an activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i w_i + \\beta > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_i$ is the $i$-th input\n",
    "- $w_i$ is the $i$-th weight \n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the bias \n",
    "- $n$ is the number of inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are adjusted during training to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start be implementing a basic perceptron model. You should finish the `perceptron` function below, based on the formula for the perceptron given above."

    "Finally, we can train the model. Training a neural network involves iteratively updating its weights to minimize the loss function. This process is typically achieved using gradient descent optimization algorithms. Here's an in-depth explanation of the training loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Epochs**: An epoch represents one complete forward and backward pass of all the training examples. The number of epochs (num_epochs) is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Usually a custom hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Training Mode**: Neural networks can operate in different modes - training and evaluation. Some layers, like dropout, behave differently in these modes. Setting the model to training mode ensures that layers like dropout function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Batch Processing**: Instead of updating weights after every training example (stochastic gradient descent) or after the entire dataset (batch gradient descent), we often update weights after a set of training examples known as a batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zeroing Gradients**: In PyTorch, gradients accumulate by default. Before calculating the new gradients in the current batch, we need to set the previous gradients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass**: The input data (images) are passed through the network, layer by layer, until we get the output. This process is called the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Loss**: Once we have the network's predictions (outputs), we compare them to the true labels using a loss function. This gives a measure of how well the network's predictions match the actual labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backward Pass**: To update the weights, we need to know the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight. The backward pass computes these gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update Weights**: The optimizer updates the weights based on the gradients computed in the backward pass.\n",
