    "# 5. Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Taught by: Dat Doan, Alex Ganose\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fifth practical session! This notebook should be run locally or on Google Colab - this can be achieved by clicking the rocket icon on the top right and selecting `Colab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this locally or on Colab, you'll need to install the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install transformers[torch] datasets accelerate sentencepiece rdkit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will cover the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brief recap on LLMs\n",
    "2. Introduction to tokenisation\n",
    "3. Generating text and the concept of temperature\n",
    "4. Fine-tuning on a custom dataset\n",
    "5. Pretrained chemistry language models\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Large Language Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They have revolutionized natural language processing and found applications across many domains, including chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A brief history:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2017: Introduction of the Transformer architecture in \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al.\n",
    "- 2018: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google\n",
    "- 2018: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI\n",
    "- 2019: GPT-2 demonstrates impressive text generation capabilities\n",
    "- 2020: GPT-3 shows emergence of in-context learning with 175 billion parameters\n",
    "- 2022: ChatGPT brings LLMs to mainstream attention\n",
    "- 2023: Explosion of open-source models (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-training**: Models are trained on large text corpora to learn language patterns\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning**: Models are adapted to specific tasks with smaller, task-specific datasets\n",
    "- **Transformers**: The underlying architecture based on self-attention mechanisms\n",
    "- **Autoregressive generation**: Models predict the next token based on previous tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications in chemistry:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Molecule generation and design\n",
    "- Retrosynthesis prediction\n",
    "- Property prediction from molecular descriptions\n",
    "- Literature mining and knowledge extraction\n",
    "- Chemical reaction prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a language model can process text, it must be converted into numerical representations. This process is called tokenisation. Tokens are the basic units that a model works with - they could be words, subwords, or even individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not just use words?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited vocabulary: Using whole words would require an enormous vocabulary\n",
    "- Unknown words: New or rare words wouldn't be in the vocabulary\n",
    "- Efficiency: Subword tokenisation provides a good balance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common tokenisation methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs\n",
    "- **WordPiece**: Similar to BPE but used by BERT\n",
    "- **SentencePiece**: Language-independent tokenisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore tokenisation using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.\n",
    "We'll use a pre-trained tokenizer for distilgpt2.\n",
    "This is a smaller version of GPT-2, designed to be more efficient while retaining much of the original model's capabilities.\n",
    "This tokenizer uses Byte-Pair Encoding to split text into subword tokens. It has a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens."

    "1. **Small datasets**: Many of our toy datasets are far too small for real predictions\n",

    "4. **Real applications**: Production systems use:\n",
    "   - Much larger datasets (e.g., USPTO reaction database with millions of reactions)\n",
    "   - Specialized architectures (e.g., Molecular Transformer)\n",
    "   - Post-processing to ensure chemical validity\n",
